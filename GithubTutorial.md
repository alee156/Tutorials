# Github tutorial

Hello there! Today we're going to learn about Github.  Github is a platform that allows its users (you) to create, manage, and share projects with others.  It also allows you to view and access the thousands of open-source projects also created on Github.  Its a valuable tool for both beginning and experienced programmers, but before we can use everything Github has to offer, first we must make an account.

## Signing up for Github:
*Step 1:* Let's navigate to Github's homepage.  You can either google "Github" to type in the URL: https://github.com/.

*Step 2:* Great.  Now that we are on the homepage, look in the top right corner of the website.  You should see the words "Sign up."  Click on it to begin the sign up process.

*Step 3:* Now we need to fill in three fields.  The first is a username.  Express yourself.  Next we need an email address.  This is so Github can contact you about information and projects you will be working on.  Finally, we need a password.  For security's sake, I suggest using a password that is different than your other passwords.  When you're done, click continue.

*Step 4:* Next we must choose a plan.  I would recommend the free plan for now, the premium plan would be more for private companies.

*Step 5:* This step is optional, but you can let Github know how experienced you are with programming.  Don't worry, your answers will not have an effect on what utilities you can access and use.  It's just so Github knows what advice they should give, if at all.  You may skip this step if you would like.

*Step 6:* Once you've finished registering, go to the email account you submitted in step 3.  Click the button in the confirmation email to activate your account.

Congratulations! Now you've signed up for Github and can access everything it can offer.  You can do a little exploring on your own if you would like.  If you would like some more information on how to use Github, look no further.  You can use Github's own project tutorial, or you can follow along.

## Starting a Project
Projects are housed in repositories.  These repositories will hold all the necessary files and information needed for a project.  So in order to start a project, first we must create a repository.

*Step 1:* Find your way back to the homepage: https://github.com/.

*Step 2:* Look in the top right corner, near your profile picture/avatar.  There should be a plus sign.  Click on it, then select "new repository."

*Step 3:* Next we need to fill in some information.  First, a name for this repository.  Make it as cool or as dull as you would like.  Next, write a short little description for the project.  What is it about?  Next you can select whether you want the project to be public (visible to anyone) or private (visible only to those you choose.)  This depends on the project.  Finally you have some options you can select, these automatically create files in your repository.  READMEs are vital for every project, they serve as descriptions, trouble shooters, and FAQs all at once.  I highly suggest checking that box off.

Cool.  Now we have created a repository.  It will be the base that houses your project.  It doesn't have anything in it just yet, but let's change that, shall we?

## Editing a Repository:
Before we go into how to edit or add to a repository, let me explain how they work.  These repositories use a system called branching.  The original file is called the master branch, and any edits to it "branch" off of that master branch.  These edits are called feature branches, and can be merged back into the master branch to update the master branch.  This system offers a couple benefits.  It protects the data of the master branch since you won't be editing it directly.  So if you make a mistake that you want to undo, don't worry, you can just return to the master branch.  The system also lets other users of Github to look, suggest, and make edits of their own, with your permission of course.  Anyways, enough talking, let's see it in action.

*Step 1:* Let's create that feature branch.  Go to your repository page.  Find the button that says "branch: master."  This button shows you which branch you're on and is how you access already created branches.

*Step 2:* Click on the button that says "branch: master." Type in the name of the new branch.  The name will typically be about what you're going to change.  Click the create branch button when you're finished.

*Step 3:* Now you're in the new branch.  Time to make some changes.  When you're done, write a short description on what you've changed, then hit commit to save those changes.

*Step 4:* Perfect.  Now we need to merge those changes into the master branch.  We can do this through a pull request.  Open a pull request by clicking on the pull request tab, then clicking on "new pull request."  Select the branch you made.  Github will automatically compare the changes you've made to the original so look over them until you're satisfied.  Clikc on the green "Create pull request" button to submit the pull request.

*Step 5:* The pull request has been submitted.  If you're working with or for someone else, you should wait to see what they think of the pull request.  If they approve, then they will merge it to the repository.  If you're in charge, here's how you merge pull requests onto the master branch: Click the green "merge pull request" button on the repository page.  Click confirm merge, and viola!  The master branch has been updated.  To keep things organized, I advise deleting the feature branch afterwards, but you may want to save it to keep track of your progress.

Congratulations!  You've made it through our tutorial.  Well done.  Now you know everything you need to know about making, sharing, and editing a project.  Time for you to tackle your own projects. If you ever need a refresher on how things work, this tutorial will be available for you.  Happy programming!
