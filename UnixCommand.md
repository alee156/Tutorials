# Unix Command Tutorials #
## Background ##
 * The command line is a text interface for your computer, you can navigate through files using text.
 
## How to use it ##
 * To start, we need to type in a *terminal*.
 
## Basic Commands
 * **ls**(Letter not number 1) to list all the files and directories in the working directories
     A directory is the same thing as a folder, you can think of the **ls** command as listing all the folders and files available.
 * **pwd** to outputs the name of the current working directory
     The current working directory is the folder you are currently working on
 * **cd** to switch you into the directory you specify
 * **mkdir** to create a new directory
     This is the exact same command as right clicking on the screen and creating a new folder
 * **touch** to create a new file inside the working directory
     This creates a file that you can edit with any standard text editor
     
     
## Simplified Analogy for crucial commands
  * You can think of a computer file system as a huge box with smaller boxes inside of it. There can be objects like toys or furniture (files) inside the boxes but the main feature of Unix commands is to find the right box for the task you have. Since every box has the possibility of having a box inside of it, your task is to go through every box as efficiently as possible to find the exact box you are looking for.
  
  * **ls** lists all the boxes and objects that are inside the box you are located inside. This, along with **cd** will likely represent the vast majority of Unix commands that you will type. This command is important because it gives you a visual graphic that you can use to figure out which box you are in instantly, as well as to look for object and files inside the box you are working in
  
  * **cd** allows you to change your directory. This allows you to enter a different box than the one you are currently in.
  
  * **mkdir** sometimes you need to create a box to put objects and other boxes inside.
